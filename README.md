## Apillon Integration

### How Votes Are Saved

- When a user votes on a movie, the vote is:
  - Sent to the blockchain via thirdweb.
  - Uploaded as a JSON file to your Apillon storage bucket using the Apillon SDK (server-side).
- Each vote file is named:  
  `votes/{address}_{movieId}_{timestamp}.json`
- The file contains:
  ```json
  {
    "movieId": 1,
    "address": "0xUserAddress",
    "voteType": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-05-01T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
  ```

### How to Verify

- Log in to your [Apillon dashboard](https://dashboard.apillon.io/).
- Go to the Storage section and select your bucket.
- Look for files in the `votes/` folder.
- Download and inspect files to see vote data.

## Customization

- **Change Bucket UUID:**  
  Update the UUID in `app/api/vote/route.tsx` if you use a different Apillon bucket.
- **Add More Vote Data:**  
  Edit the `voteData` object in the same file to include more fields.
- **UI Feedback:**  
  You can display a message to users based on the `apillonUploadSuccess` field in the API response.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Votes not appearing in Apillon:**  
  - Ensure your API key and secret are correct and have storage permissions.
  - Make sure the upload logic runs server-side (API route, not client).
  - Check server logs for errors.
- **Blockchain errors:**  
  - Ensure your wallet is connected and on the correct network (Celo).
  - Check contract address and ABI.
